# Task 2 – Titanic Data Cleaning & EDA 🚢📊

As part of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**, I performed **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.

## 🔹 Steps Performed
- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
- Converted categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`Cabin`, `Ticket`, `Name`)
- Created visualizations for survival patterns

## 🔹 Key Insights
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers survived more often than lower classes.
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
- Higher ticket fares correlated with better survival.

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🔹 Files
- [Jupyter Notebook: Task 2 Titanic EDA](Task_2.ipynb)  → Jupyter Notebook with code and plots
- [Dataset: train.csv](titanic_dataset.csv)   → Titanic dataset
